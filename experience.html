      <h2 class="Personal-life">Experience</h2>
      <p class="Personal-life">I graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University in 2022 with a degree in Chemistry. This really helped build my core problem-solving and analytcal skills that would become epecially useful later on in my career. <br>During my time at university, I worked in a restaurant where I eventually became the manager. This experience taught me valuable leadership and customer service skills, as I was responsible for overseeing daily operations and ensuring a high standard of service for our patrons.<br><br>

        After graduating, I took on a role as a Sales Development Representative at Objectivity (now aquired by Accenture), where I learned a lot about business skills, including effective communication, sales strategies, and customer relationship management. This position helped me develop a deeper understanding of the business world and allowed me to apply the analytical skills I had gained from my studies.<br><br>
        
        Driven by my passion for technology, I decided to pivot my career towards the tech industry. I started learning the basics of front-end development, focusing on technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This newfound knowledge helped me secure my current position as a Foundation Developer at Barclays. In this role, I am excited to apply my technical skills to create innovative solutions and contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact.</p>
